# Flexible and Expanded Sample

 * **Flexible -** Widget that manages the child items size. It has two arguments.
 
 * **fit -** values can be FlexFit.loose, FlexFit.tight. *FlexFit.loose -* Will increase the child size if the content grows. *FlexFit.tight -* Will take all the remaining space and shrink the element if needed to fit into that space.
 
 * **flex -** Flex can be used to minimum of 2 items. it will take the integer as a value. if two Flexible widget has flex 2,1 then it will share the remaining available full space as 2:1 ratio.
 
 **Expanded -** Flexible with FlexFit.tight is can be shorten as Expanded. both are same.
