# Using Private Properties

 * Every dart file in the application is mini library. it can work together. 
 * Adding underscore( _ ) beofre the variable name or class name makes that class / method as private so that it cannot be accessed from outside. Refer [this](https://github.com/visitmathaneid/Flutter/blob/master/flutter_basics_five/lib/main.dart) for sample.
